# 🌡️ New Open Source Project: Ultra-Low Power LoRa BME280 Network (20-22µA!)

Hi Arduino community! 👋

I'm excited to share a complete LoRa sensor network project I've been working on, with some AI assistance for documentation and code architecture.

## 🎯 **What This Project Offers:**

**Ultra-Low Power**: Sensor nodes achieve 20-22µA deep sleep (not mA - actual µA!)
**Long Range**: LoRa communication up to 10km line of sight
**CGNAT Friendly**: Perfect for T-Mobile Home Internet, Starlink - no port forwarding needed
**Complete Solution**: Hardware guides + firmware + server + deployment scripts
**Professional Grade**: Web dashboard, API, monitoring, error handling

## 🛠️ **Hardware Used:**
- **Gateway**: EoRa-S3-900TB (ESP32-S3 + SX1262)
- **Sensors**: ESP32 + LoRa + BME280
- **Power**: 18650 Li-ion for multi-year battery life

## 📊 **Real-World Performance:**
- ✅ 20-22µA sleep current achieved and verified
- ✅ 15-minute data collection cycles
- ✅ Multi-kilometer range tested
- ✅ Works through T-Mobile CGNAT
- ✅ Professional cloud dashboard

## 🌟 **Why Share This:**
The Arduino community has given me so much over the years. This project solves real problems:
- Most "low power" projects consume mA (this achieves µA)
- CGNAT networks are becoming common but break traditional IoT
- Complete IoT solutions are rare - usually just code snippets

## 🚀 **GitHub Repository:**
**https://github.com/your-username/lora-bme280-network**

**MIT Licensed** - Free for personal and commercial use!

## 🤝 **Development Notes:**
This project was developed with AI assistance (Claude) for code architecture and documentation, but all hardware testing, creative decisions, and final implementation are mine. I believe in transparent development!

## 💬 **Questions Welcome!**
Happy to answer questions about:
- Achieving ultra-low power consumption
- LoRa network design
- CGNAT workarounds
- Professional IoT deployment

Thanks to this amazing community for all the inspiration over the years! 🙏

73's,

# Ultra-Low Power LoRa BME280 Network - 20-22µA Deep Sleep, CGNAT-Friendly, Complete Open Source Solution

## TL;DR: 
Built a complete LoRa sensor network achieving actual 20-22µA sleep current (not mA!), works with T-Mobile/Starlink CGNAT, includes everything from PCB to cloud deployment. MIT licensed.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/your-username/lora-bme280-network

## The Problem I Solved:
- **Power**: Most "low power" ESP32 projects consume mA in sleep. I achieved µA.
- **Network**: T-Mobile Home Internet uses CGNAT - traditional IoT doesn't work
- **Completeness**: Most projects are just code snippets. This is production-ready.

## What's Included:
- ✅ ESP32 gateway firmware (Arduino IDE)
- ✅ Ultra-low power sensor node firmware 
- ✅ Python Flask API server with web dashboard
- ✅ One-click Digital Ocean deployment
- ✅ Complete documentation and setup guides
- ✅ PCB designs and 3D printable enclosures (coming soon)

## Hardware Stack:
- **Gateway**: EoRa-S3-900TB (ESP32-S3 + SX1262 LoRa)
- **Sensors**: ESP32 + SX1262 + BME280
- **Range**: Up to 10km line of sight
- **Battery Life**: 2-5 years on 18650

## Power Consumption Breakdown:
- **Deep Sleep**: 20-22µA (measured, not estimated)
- **LoRa TX**: ~120mA for 200ms every 15 minutes
- **Total**: Years of battery life on single 18650

## CGNAT Solution:
Instead of requiring port forwarding, gateway makes outbound HTTPS calls to your cloud server. Works with:
- T-Mobile Home Internet ✅
- Starlink ✅ 
- Corporate networks ✅
- Any CGNAT setup ✅

## Development Process:
Full transparency: I used AI assistance (Claude) for code architecture suggestions and documentation, but all hardware work, testing, and creative decisions were mine. Believe in honest development practices!

## Why Open Source This:
The ESP32 community has taught me so much. Time to give back with a complete, professional-grade solution that solves real problems.

**Questions about power optimization, LoRa networking, or CGNAT workarounds welcome!**

### **Hackaday Project Submission:**

```markdown
# Ultra-Low Power LoRa Environmental Network

## Summary:
A complete LoRa-based environmental monitoring system achieving 20-22µA deep sleep current, designed for CGNAT networks like T-Mobile Home Internet. Includes sensor nodes, gateway, cloud server, and professional web dashboard.

## Story:
Modern internet connections increasingly use CGNAT (T-Mobile, Starlink), breaking traditional IoT setups that require port forwarding. This project solves that with a "reverse" architecture where sensors push data to cloud servers via outbound connections.

The real challenge was achieving true ultra-low power consumption. Most ESP32 "low power" projects consume milliamps. Through careful hardware selection (EoRa-S3-900TB), optimized firmware, and proper sleep techniques, this achieves microamp sleep current for multi-year battery life.

## Technical Details:
- **Architecture**: LoRa sensor nodes → ESP32 gateway → Cloud API server
- **Power**: 20-22µA deep sleep, 2-5 year battery life
- **Range**: Up to 10km with proper antennas
- **Scalability**: 100+ nodes per gateway
- **Network**: Works through any NAT/CGNAT setup

## Development Approach:
This project demonstrates modern development practices - combining human expertise with AI assistance. All hardware work and testing was hands-on, while AI helped with code architecture and documentation. Full transparency in development process.

## Impact:
Provides the maker community with a complete, professional-grade IoT solution that works with modern internet infrastructure. Fills gap between simple tutorials and expensive commercial solutions.
