Each Eora Pi node requires a BME280 and a 74HC04 (74HC series is important for its microcontroller friendly 
operating voltage and no level shifter required).  74HC04 is required to reroute DIO1 signal from GPIO33 to
GPIO16; which is a RTC wake capable GPIO.

Gateway requires no wiring, No connections at all.
